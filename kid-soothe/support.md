## About KidSoothe

KidSoothe is a watchOS app that provides time-limited screen dimming to help parents soothe their children to sleep. Unlike the built-in Theatre Mode which stays on until manually disabled, KidSoothe automatically turns off after your selected duration.

## Features

- **Auto-disable Timer**: Select duration of 1 hour or 2 hours
- **Dark Screen Mode**: Displays a completely black screen when active
- **Background Support**: Timer continues running even when app is closed
- **Persistent State**: Timer survives app restarts

## How to Use

1. Open KidSoothe on your Apple Watch
2. Tap the "Soothe" button
3. Select your desired duration (1 hour or 2 hours)
4. The screen will go completely dark
5. The timer automatically ends after the selected time
6. Double-tap the screen to exit early if needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is the screen completely black?

When active, KidSoothe displays a completely black screen to minimize light and help your child fall asleep more easily.

### How do I exit before the timer ends?

Double-tap the screen to immediately exit dark mode and return to the main screen.

### Does the timer work when I'm not looking at the app?

Yes! KidSoothe uses extended runtime sessions to ensure the timer continues running in the background even when you navigate away from the app.

### What watchOS version is required?

KidSoothe requires watchOS 9.0 or later.

## Troubleshooting

### App not appearing on Apple Watch

1. Ensure your Apple Watch is paired with your iPhone
